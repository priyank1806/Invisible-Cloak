1. Python: The primary programming language used for this project.
2. OpenCV: An open-source computer vision library that will handle most of the image processing tasks.
3. Webcam: To capture real-time video feed.
4. Colored cloth: Preferably a single-colored cloth (often red or green) to act as the "invisibility cloak."
